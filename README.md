# stickBot Dashboard

## Description

This is the in-development Web Dashboard for the stickBot Discord Bot. It is currently considered to be in early alpha, so everything is subject to change. There will likely be a lot of placeholder assets, poor performance, and poorly--or completely unimplemented--features until such a time comes that we transition to a beta state.

### Details

This Dashboard is based on the [Materio Admin Template](https://github.com/themeselection/materio-vuetify-vuejs-admin-template-free) by [ThemeSelection](https://themeselection.com/). It uses the [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) Component Framework on top of [Vue.js 3](https://vuejs.org/). The Dashboard communicates with stickBot using [@sapphire/plugin-api](https://github.com/sapphiredev/plugins/tree/main/packages/api).
